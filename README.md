## Overview of the dataset

This dataset includes the processing-microstructure-mechanical property (PMP) features for the laser powder bed fusion additive-manufactured metal materials. The objective of this dataset is to provide quantitative data on the microstructural features and mechanical properties from a range of process parameter combinations. The dataset has been used to investigate PMP relationships with machine learning. 

This dataset includes data from 127 literature resources as listed in the reference list: <a href="https://github.com/JingwenGao/MetalLPBF_PMP/Reference_list.txt" target="_blank">Link</a>
